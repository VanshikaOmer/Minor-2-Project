## Introduction
SkillSync is an innovative platform that addresses the growing demand for continuous skill development by offering a comprehensive platform that revolutionizes skill assessment and enhancement. Our platform provides real-time feedback, assessments, and live interaction features, creating a dynamic and interactive learning environment for skill development.

## Problem Statement

Traditional skill assessment platforms often provide fragmented experiences, lacking the necessary integration that allows for a seamless skill development journey. Users frequently find themselves toggling between multiple tools and platforms to complete different aspects of their learning, from assessments to feedback to real-time interviews. This not only leads to a disjointed learning experience but also results in significant time inefficiencies and reduced productivity.

In response to these challenges, we developed SkillSync—a one-stop solution designed to integrate assessment, feedback, live interviews, and collaborative learning into a single platform. SkillSync streamlines the skill development process and maximizes productivity by catering to both technical and communication skills.

## Objective

- To design a skill assessment platform with adaptive features, offering coding challenges and immediate feedback for continuous skill development.

<b> Sub-Objectives </b>
- To introduce live interviews and live collaboration, showcasing teamwork and communication skills, while ensuring an intuitive and engaging user interface.
- To develop a robust, object-oriented codebase and a database architecture for efficient storage and retrieval of user data and assessment results, ensuring easy maintainability and platform scalability.
